  Once you have competed at a competition for the first time, you will automatically have a WCA ID 
  generated for you. This will then be linked to your WCA account you registered with, so that 
  you may upload a picture if you wish, and also sign up for future competitions. For your first 
  competition you only need a <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/users/sign_up" class="blueLink">
  WCA account</a>, not a WCA ID.
