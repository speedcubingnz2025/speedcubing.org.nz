<p>
  There are currently <a href="../getting-started#events_info" class="blueLink">17 official WCA events</a>, 
  but most competitions won’t hold every event. Make sure to check the “Events” tab on the 
  competition’s WCA page to see which events are being held, and to see the time limit/cut 
  off for each event. If you think you can meet the time limit for an event, give it a go!
