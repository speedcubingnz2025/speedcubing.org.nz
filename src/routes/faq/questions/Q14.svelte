  You should bring some form of ID, something to eat for lunch (although there are often food 
  options near the competition venue), and your cubes. You will use your own cubes to compete, 
  so make sure they are clean, undamaged, and otherwise comply with the 
  <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-3-puzzles" class="blueLink">Puzzles</a> 
  section of the WCA Regulations. There are also hundreds of cubes at competitions — make sure 
  to keep track of yours, as they can easily get mixed up!
