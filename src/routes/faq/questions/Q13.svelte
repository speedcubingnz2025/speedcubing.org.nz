<p>
  To make sure competitions run on schedule, many events have a “cut off” and a “time limit”, 
  which will be listed on the “Events” tab on the competition’s WCA page.<br><br>The time limit
  is the maximum time allowed for a solve — if you haven’t solved the puzzle when you hit the 
  time limit, the attempt will be marked as a DNF (Did Not Finish). These time limits are 
  usually quite generous though, so most competitors won’t need to worry about hitting them.
  <br><br>The cutoff is a stricter requirement which determines how many solves you do in a 
  round. If you achieve a solve faster than the cutoff within your first 2 solves*, then you 
  will be allowed to complete your average. If you don’t, then your first two solves will still 
  count, but you will be unable to complete your last 3. This is just to make sure that we 
  don’t run behind schedule.<br><br>*For 6x6 and 7x7, the cutoff is after just 1 solve.
