  Yes! We encourage spectators, and it’s often a good idea to come to a competition to see 
  what it’s all about. It can look a bit chaotic at first, but they are well organised and 
  everyone is very friendly! You can have a great time without competing, and it can give you 
  an opportunity to try out the timers during lunch break.
