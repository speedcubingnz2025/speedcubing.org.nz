  When a competition’s registration period is open, you can register on the competition page 
  on the WCA website. You will not be added to the competitor list until you have paid, so make 
  sure to do so! If the competitor limit for the competition is full, you will be put on a 
  waiting list and alerted if you get a place due to others dropping out. Please read all 
  the information on the relevant WCA page for the competition.
