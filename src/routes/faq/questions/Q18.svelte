<p>
  During the competition, results will be uploaded to <a href="https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/" class="blueLink"> 
  WCA Live</a>. This may take up to an hour, so please be patient. WCA Live will also allow you to see 
  whether you’ve advanced to the next round. Competitors whose name is highlighted bright green are 
  confirmed to have made the next round. Competitors whose name is dull green are currently set to 
  advance to the next round, but this may change as data entry for the round is ongoing.<br><br>
  After the competition is over, results will be verified and then uploaded to the 
  <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings" class="blueLink">WCA Database</a>. 
  This may take several days. Once this is done, you will be able to find your results listed on 
  the competition page, and on your WCA profile.
