  Absolutely! Many competitors film their solves, and there are also often parents taking photos or 
  videos. There are a few important rules to remember however: <br>
  • Do NOT use flash<br>
  • Spectators MUST be 1.5M away from the solving station at all times<br>
  • Competitors MUST NOT be able to see the screen of the camera filming their solve<br>
  • Do NOT film the solves of another competitor in your group
