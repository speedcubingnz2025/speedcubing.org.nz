  We have a list of all our announced upcoming competitions <a href="../competitions#competitions" class="blueLink">
  here</a>. We usually try to organise competitions that service each of the major population centres 
  in New Zealand at least a few times per year, but we rely on local volunteer organisers, so this 
  can vary. If you’re keen for a competition in your area, we always welcome people getting involved 
  by <a href="../competitions#organising" class="blueLink">organising</a>!
